xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. We would like you to perform the following steps:



Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.

Create an email account ravi@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by B4zNgHA7Ya.

Set its mail directory to /home/ravi/Maildir.

Install and configure dovecot on the same server
