The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.



As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.
