1. Check the presence of an ssh key

        ls -al ~/.ssh/id_*.pub


2. If not present, Create a new ssh key

        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

3. Upload Public Key to remote server to ensure password less connectivity

        ssh-copy-id [remote_user]@[server_ip_address]

        in our case, we are to do this for all app servers in the nautilus datacenter

        ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01
        ssh-copy-id steve@stapp02
        ssh-copy-id banner@stapp03

4. SSH into one of the appserver to test password-less ssh connectivity

        ssh tony@stapp01
